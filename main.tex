\chapter*{Plagiarism Certificate}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Plagiarism Certificate}

\paragraph{I hereby certify that I have thoroughly examined the document titled Ensuring "Ethical Compliance in DevOps Implementation for Regulated Industries", submitted by \underline{Neelanjan Mukherji}, and conducted an extensive plagiarism analysis using advanced software tools and manual evaluation techniques. Based on my findings, I hereby declare that the overall percentage of plagiarized content within the aforementioned document is \underline{12\%}.}

\paragraph{Plagiarism, as defined by reputable academic and professional institutions, refers to the act of presenting someone else's ideas, words, or work as one's own without proper attribution or citation. It is a serious offense that undermines the principles of intellectual integrity and academic honesty.}

\paragraph{The analysis conducted involved a comprehensive examination of the document, including its textual content, references, and citations, as well as cross-referencing against a vast database of published works, online sources, and academic databases. The examination aimed to identify instances of direct copying, paraphrasing without appropriate acknowledgment, and improper citation.}

\paragraph{Throughout the evaluation process, the document in question exhibited several instances of content that could be attributed to external sources without appropriate citation or acknowledgment. These instances encompass both verbatim copying of textual passages as well as paraphrasing of ideas without proper attribution. The cumulative percentage of plagiarized content, as calculated through this thorough examination, amounts to \underline{12\%} of the total document.}

\paragraph{It is imperative to note that the aforementioned percentage is an estimation based on the techniques and tools employed during the analysis. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of this assessment, the detection of plagiarism is a complex process that may have limitations. Therefore, the declared percentage should be considered as an approximation rather than an absolute measure.}

\paragraph{This certificate is issued solely for the purpose of bringing to light the presence of plagiarized content within the document and promoting a culture of academic integrity. It is intended to serve as a notification to the concerned parties and initiate appropriate actions to rectify the identified issues.}

\paragraph{I trust that the relevant authorities will address this matter with utmost seriousness, adhering to the established policies and guidelines for academic integrity and intellectual property. Proper steps should be taken to ensure that the identified instances of plagiarism are addressed and appropriate consequences, as outlined by the respective institution's regulations, are implemented.}
